Problem Statement and Motivation:

This project aims to build an automated deep-learning system that accurately detects diseases from leaf images and causes of this disease, provide remedies to cure diseases, prevention tips.
Crop diseases cause major yield loss, and many farmers lack quick access to experts. A simple AI-based detection system can help farmers identify diseases early using just an image.

METHODOLOGY:

Data Collection – Gather plant leaf images (healthy and diseased).
Data Preparation – Organize and split images into train, validation, and test sets.
Data Preprocessing & Augmentation – Resize, normalize, and apply transformations (flip, rotate, zoom).
Model Development – Use EfficientNetB4 as the base pre-trained model.
Custom Classification Head – Add pooling, dropout, and dense layers for prediction.
Training Phase (Transfer Learning) – Train only the new classifier layers first.
Fine-Tuning Phase – Unfreeze top Efficient Net layers and retrain with small learning rate.
Model Evaluation – Test model accuracy and confidence on unseen data.
Model Saving – Save the trained model for deployment in a web app.

COMPLETE GUIDE TO BUILD THIS PROJECT:

# 🌿 Plant Disease Classifier – Streamlit App

A deep-learning powered web app that detects **plant leaf diseases** from an uploaded image and provides:

✔ Top-3 predictions with confidence
✔ Full disease info (symptoms, causes, remedies, prevention)
✔ Downloadable **PDF diagnosis report**
✔ Clean Streamlit UI for fast testing
✔ Supports 38+ plant leaf disease classes



## 📌 Features

### 🔍 **1. Accurate Disease Classification**

* Upload a leaf image (JPG/PNG)
* Model predicts the **top-3 possible diseases**
* Displays probability bar chart

### 📚 **2. Detailed Disease Knowledge Base**

For the top prediction:

* Symptoms
* Causes
* Remedies
* Prevention
* Display name for each disease

### 📄 **3. PDF Report Generation**

* Generates a professional report including:

  * Disease name
  * Confidence score
  * Symptoms, causes, remedies, prevention
  * Timestamp
* One-click download as **PDF**

### ⚡ **4. Lightweight & Fast**

* Optimized TensorFlow model loading
* Uses caching for faster response

## 🔧 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the project

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd project-folder


### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

The app uses the following key packages:
streamlit
tensorflow
pillow
matplotlib
numpy
reportlab

## ▶️ Run the Application

Start Streamlit:
streamlit run app.py

The app will open in your browser at:
http://localhost:8501

## 🧠 Model Used

The app loads a TensorFlow/Keras model:
plant_disease_prediction_model.h5

* Trained on 38+ plant diseases
* Outputs class probabilities
* Index-to-class mapping is loaded from `class_indices.json`

## 📄 PDF Report Example

The generated PDF contains:
PLANT DISEASE DIAGNOSIS REPORT
---------------------------------------
Disease Name: Tomato Leaf Spot
Prediction Confidence: 94.55%
Generated On: 2025-01-12 10:23:45

Symptoms:
 - Brown circular patches
 - Leaf yellowing
 - Dry edges

Causes:
 - Fungal infection
 - Overwatering

Remedies:
 - Remove infected leaves
 - Apply fungicide spray

Prevention:
 - Maintain spacing
 - Use resistant seeds

---------------------------------------
Generated by Plant Disease Predictor App

## 📝 How the PDF is Generated

The app uses **ReportLab**:

```
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
```

A PDF buffer is created and returned for download using:

```
st.download_button(
    label="📄 Download Report (PDF)",
    data=pdf_buffer,
    file_name="report.pdf",
    mime="application/pdf"
)
```

## 💡 Tips for Best Predictions

* Use clear, well-lit images
* Zoom so the leaf fills most of the frame
* Avoid blurred pictures
* Use green leaves (not dried/brown leaves unless disease-specific)

---

## 🛠 Future Enhancements

* Add crop recommendation
* Add multi-leaf batch upload support
* Add mobile responsive UI
* Add real-time webcam scanning
